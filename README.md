# jqueryVSjavascript

One of the reasons why people use native javascript could be because some of the commands may be much faster than the jQuery codes. According to Sitepoint, while jQuery is more convenient, using native javascript will fetch only the nodes that you specifically ask for, which will be less taxing because jQuery will select all nodes. Moreover, jQuery also can slow down some sites, especially for older browsers which may not understand the new types. In the article “Ditching jQuery for Vanilla Javascript,” using javascript over jQuery has given websites better performances and smoothed out browser inconsistencies. The writer also mentions that new javascript, while not supported by browsers for everyday use, lets users add, remove, and toggle classes as easily as with jQuery.
